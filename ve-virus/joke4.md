# Ultimate Virus Simulation (Educational)

## Overview
This AutoHotkey script simulates various virus behaviors for **educational purposes only**. It demonstrates common malware tactics in a safe, reversible environment without causing actual harm to your system. The simulation includes visual effects, fake warnings, and simulated attacks to help users recognize real threats.

## Key Features
- Visual disturbances: Screen rotation, shaking, color inversion
- Fake system warnings: BSOD, ransomware notes, antivirus alerts
- Interaction hijacking: Mouse jitter, keyboard interference
- Browser manipulation: Forced site redirects
- File operations: Fake encrypted files, desktop clutter
- Security simulations: Password stealers, keyloggers
- Performance degradation: Fake memory leaks, CPU overload

## Safety Features
- All effects are reversible
- No actual files modified/deleted
- Emergency stop hotkey (Ctrl+Alt+End)
- Pause/resume functionality (Ctrl+Alt+D)
- Automatic cleanup on exit
- Educational popups explaining each simulation

## How to Use
1. Install AutoHotkey v1.1+
2. Run the script (double-click .ahk file)
3. Emergency stop: Press Ctrl+Alt+End anytime
4. Toggle simulation: Ctrl+Alt+D (pause/resume)
5. Reload script: Ctrl+Alt+R
6. Show education menu: F1

## Simulated Behaviors

### Visual Effects
- Screen rotation (0째/90째/180째/270째)
- Screen shaking
- Color inversion
- Fake BSOD (Blue Screen of Death)
- Fake webcam activation light
- Screen flickering

### System Warnings
- Fake antivirus scans (Windows Defender simulation)
- Ransomware notes
- Memory leak warnings
- Process injection alerts
- Network activity monitors
- Critical update prompts
- System crash warnings

### Browser Hijacks
- Automatic browser restarts
- Forced Rick Rolls (youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)
- Fullscreen browser windows
- Unclosable browser tabs (temporary)
- Site redirects to security websites

### Input Manipulation
- Mouse cursor jitter
- Random keyboard presses
- Clipboard hijacking (ransom messages)
- Alt+Tab disabling
- Mouse button swapping (left/right)

### File Operations
- Fake encrypted files (.encrypted)
- Desktop warning files (.txt)
- Suspicious shortcuts (.lnk)
- Fake keylogger logs
- Bitcoin miner interface

### Audio Effects
- Random system beeps
- Windows error sounds
- Fake hardware failure beeps
- Disk error simulations

## Educational Value
This script demonstrates:
- How malware manipulates user interfaces
- Common social engineering tactics
- Importance of recognizing fake warnings
- Why you shouldn't panic during real attacks
- How legitimate system features can be abused

## Technical Notes
- Task Manager is temporarily disabled during simulation
- Original wallpaper is restored on exit
- Display orientation resets automatically
- Desktop files are removed when stopped
- All GUI windows close during emergency stop

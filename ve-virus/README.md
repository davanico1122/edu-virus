# Advanced Cybersecurity Simulation Tool

> **Warning**  
> This is an educational tool designed to demonstrate malware behavior in a safe environment.  
> DO NOT use for malicious purposes. Use responsibly and only with proper authorization.

## Overview
This AutoHotkey script simulates various malware behaviors for cybersecurity education purposes. It demonstrates common attack techniques while providing safe mechanisms to stop the simulation at any time.

## Key Features
- Realistic ransomware simulation (without actual encryption)
- Screen rotation effects
- System tools restriction (Task Manager, CMD, Registry Editor)
- Browser manipulation
- Fake error messages and security alerts
- Startup persistence simulation
- Data exfiltration simulation
- Cryptocurrency mining simulation
- Registry modification simulation

## Safety Features
- **Emergency Stop**: Ctrl+Alt+End (instantly reverses all effects)
- **Pause/Resume**: Ctrl+Alt+D
- **Educational Info**: F1
- All effects are temporary and reversible
- No permanent system modifications

## Requirements

## üìã Overview

Educational virus simulation script built with AutoHotkey v1.1 for cybersecurity learning purposes. This script demonstrates common malware behaviors in a safe, controlled environment without causing permanent damage to your system.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER

**üî¥ THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY**
- This simulation is designed for cybersecurity education
- No actual harm will be done to your system
- All effects are temporary and reversible
- Use only in controlled environments
- Not intended for malicious use

## üéØ Features

### Browser Effects
- **Automatic website opening**: Opens random educational/entertainment sites
- **Browser persistence**: Automatically restarts closed browsers
- **Rick Roll integration**: Occasional Rick Roll for demonstration

### System Disruption Effects
- **Window randomization**: Moves and resizes open windows randomly
- **Mouse jitter**: Simulates unauthorized mouse movement
- **Screen rotation**: Temporarily rotates display 180 degrees
- **Screen shake**: Makes windows vibrate/shake

### Social Engineering Simulation
- **Fake error messages**: Displays realistic but harmless error notifications
- **Fake system scans**: Shows progress bars with fake threat detection
- **Clipboard manipulation**: Temporarily changes clipboard content
- **Desktop file creation**: Creates harmless text files on desktop

### Audio Effects
- **Random beeps**: Plays system beeps at random intervals
- **Frequency variation**: Different pitch and duration sounds

## üöÄ Installation & Usage

### Prerequisites
- Windows operating system
- AutoHotkey v1.1 installed
- Administrator privileges (recommended)

### Installation Steps
1. **Download AutoHotkey v1.1** from [official website](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
2. **Save the script** as `virus_simulation.ahk`
3. **Right-click** the file and select "Compile Script" to create `.exe`
4. **Run the executable** with administrator privileges

### First Run
1. A warning dialog will appear explaining the simulation
2. Press **OK** to continue or **Cancel** to abort
3. Effects will begin automatically
4. Press **F1** for help and educational information

## üéÆ Controls

| Hotkey | Function |
|--------|----------|
| `Ctrl+Alt+End` | **Emergency Stop** - Immediately stops all effects |
| `Ctrl+Alt+D` | **Toggle** - Pause/Resume simulation |
| `F1` | **Help Menu** - Shows educational information |
| `Ctrl+Alt+R` | **Reload** - Restarts the script |

## üìä Effect Timeline

| Interval | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| Every 10 seconds | Random main effects (browser, windows, mouse, etc.) |
| Every 30 seconds | Random audio beeps |
| Every 5 seconds | Browser process monitoring |
| Every 60 seconds | Screen effects (rotation, shake) |

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

### Built-in Protections
- **Emergency stop hotkey**: Instant termination with Ctrl+Alt+End
- **No permanent changes**: All effects are temporary
- **No file encryption**: Your data remains untouched
- **No network attacks**: Only opens educational websites
- **Automatic cleanup**: Removes created files on exit

### Recovery Methods
1. **Use emergency hotkey**: `Ctrl+Alt+End`
2. **Task Manager**: End AutoHotkey process
3. **System restart**: Complete reset of all effects
4. **Safe Mode**: Boot in safe mode if needed

## üéì Educational Value

### Malware Techniques Demonstrated
1. **Persistence**: Restarting closed processes
2. **System disruption**: Window manipulation and screen effects
3. **Social engineering**: Fake warnings and error messages
4. **Resource consumption**: Audio and visual effects
5. **User interface hijacking**: Mouse and clipboard control

### Real Malware Comparison
| Simulation | Real Malware |
|------------|--------------|
| Temporary effects | Permanent damage |
| Educational websites | Malicious sites |
| Reversible changes | Data encryption/theft |
| Safe file creation | System file corruption |
| Audio beeps | Silent operation |
